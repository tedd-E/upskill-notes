## Self Contained Systems
### Overview
An architectural approach that separates a larger system's functionality into many independent, collaborating systems. Relies on the concept of Bounded Context from domain-driven design.
* Bounded context: a logical boundary with clear definitions on terms, entities, and operations. This avoids any confusion from any ambiguities or overlapping meanings (ex: the word "yard" can refer to the measurement or the place, but this ambiguity would be clearly defined in a bounded context)


### Monoliths and Microservices
* "Big ball of mud concept": a system with parts that are tightly coupled and interdependent, making it difficult to change or scale.
  * Monolith: components 
  * Microservices: service are interdependent, difficult to modify one without breaking functionality in the other
* Similarly, monoliths and microservices can be modularly designed.


### SCS 
* Self contained systems split a monolithic system along its domains and wrap each domain in a separate, replaceable web application. 
* Each SCS contains its own UI, specific business logic, and separate data storage. 
  * Drawback: There may be redundancies between data in SCS. This is tolerable as long as the data between different SCS stays independent.
* It can also have an optional API.
* SCS do not communicate with each other. Since SCS can work independently, there is no need for communication.
* SCS can be integrated through web interfaces to minimze coupling to other systems.
* SCS should avoid synchronous calls. API calls should be asynchronous to minimize dependencies and prevent error cascades.
  * Drawback: This implies that the data model's consistency guarantees will have to be more relaxed.

### SCS vs Microservices
* Size and scope:
  * SCS are larger and handle complete business capabilities within UI
